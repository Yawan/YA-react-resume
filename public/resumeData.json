My favorite sport is snowboarding, although I live on an island with a subtropical climate and rarely see snow. In the era of booming online courses, I am fortunate to learn lots of skills and keep moving up. Lately, I have finished some web development courses on Udemy and Youtube. I hope to have the opportunity to work with you in the future. Thank you.",
